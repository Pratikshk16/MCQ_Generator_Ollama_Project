# MCQ Generator using Ollama (Local LLM)

This project is a **Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Generator** built using **LangChain** and **Ollama** with a **local Large Language Model (LLM)**.  
It generates high-quality MCQs from **PDF or TXT files** and optionally evaluates the difficulty of the questions.

The entire system runs **locally** — no OpenAI API key or internet connection is required.
